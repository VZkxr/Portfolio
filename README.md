## Description

Hello there! üëã Welcome to my portfolio, where I've compiled a diverse array of projects showcasing my skills and interests in finance, web scraping, databases, and a touch of leisure activities for good measure. 
Whether you're here to explore potential collaborations, evaluate my work, or simply out of curiosity, I'm glad you stopped by.

## About some projects
**Ghidora:**
For this project, only the Regex library is required. The project is purely experimental, exploring a type of alphanumeric encryption. It's not recommended for use in high-security situations.

**Employee Manager:**
This project requires some libraries that are not included by default in Tkinter or Custom Tkinter, so it will be necessary to install [CTkMenuBar](https://github.com/Akascape/CTkMenuBar).
